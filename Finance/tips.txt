1. Save for rainy day . Build a emergency corpus - enough to survive atleast for a year .

2. Get term , health insurance first . 

3. Golden rule - Equity exposure should be 100 - age in years and rest in debt  e.g. say you are 30 , 
invest 30 percent of money in equity , rest in debt based instruments.
