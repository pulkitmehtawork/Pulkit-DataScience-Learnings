I have been working in IT industry for 13 plus years . Well , years doesnt mean anything but have seen lots of ups and downs . 
Below are some of the thoughts , quote I read at different places which keeps me grounded at difficult times . 
I have seen lot of ups and downs in Life , at work , relationships . Some of the thoughts will be mine , some are borrowed from books , great thinkers ....


1. I love the phrase from Bible . This too shall pass . Isn't it beautiful ?
2. There is some verse in Gita which empahsizes to focus on doing work and not worry about the result . Trust the process . 
Keep hustling , keep learning , keep experiencing .. the annoying buy , the scolding from manager , failed deliverable , succesful rollouts , 
appreciation email , onsite opportunities - you may experience all or few of those things but try to learn from each experience ..
