System design is very interesting and important topic . 
You will be invariably asked to build ML powered or some system in all big companies . 
It shows your problem solving skills , architecture knowledge and communication skills . 
Some interviews focus on high level design while focus on details of a particular area of the system .
Requirements , bottlenecks should be understood well .

You tube playlist of Gaurav Sain . He explains concept in witty way . He also solves doubts of folks in the comments . 

1. Database sharding - It is like we are dividing data into different ranges and persisting at different locations/servers.
It makes our queries faster but think what will happen when we have to query data scross shards .. shards data will join , there will be 
communication across shards and thats gonna be expensive . 

2. SQL vs No SQL . If your data is unstructuted , you have massive amount of data and need super low latency then go with No- SQL databases .

3. Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling - Vertical scaling or scaling up is adding more power to your existing servers while horizonal scaling 
or scaling out is adding more servers to your pool . Disadvantages of vertical scaling is that it has a hard limit , no failover and redundancy mechanism.
For large scale application , horizontal scaling is recommended .
