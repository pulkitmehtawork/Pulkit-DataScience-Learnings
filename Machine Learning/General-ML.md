**Bias and variance trade off **

Bias is the wrong assumption we have while creating the model say data is non linear but we assumed it is linear .
It leads to underfitting the data .

Variance is the sensitivity of the model to the variations in the data . It leads to overfitting .
By increasing variance ( increasing complexity of the model )  , we decrease bias and vice-versa. So , it is a trade off .
