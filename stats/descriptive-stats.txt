1.  population and sample - In practice , most of the times we are working with sample of the data .
Samplings - dos and donts -  1.1 - Sample should be representative of the population , 1.2. should be a random sample , not from 
a specific group , 1.3 - all samples should be independent of each other . 


2.Descriptive stats - summarizes characteristics of the data .

3. How to show categorical data - Bar charts of frequency , bar chart of relative ferquency is a good idea . Do not go for Pie chart unless you
just have 2 variables as it is difficult to understand . 

4. Difference between Histogram and barchart  - Histograms are for quantitative data while bar chart is for categorical data .
Historgram - we split data into buckets or bins of equal size . They are exclusive and do not overlap . 
Seclecting number of bins is experimental . 
Skewness in histogram - Right or left skewed depending on tail is thinnest at what side of the graph .
Uniform - number of observations in each bin is same . 
symmetric - left and right side is mirror image . 
bimodal - there are 2 peaks like humps of camel . 

5. Stem and leaf - This is one more way to express quantitative data . Stem is at the left and leaf is at the right . 
Leaf is the last digit . It shows shape of the data distribution , it shows modality and rank of order of data . 
It is kind of sideway histogram but it shows elements with highest frequency easily unlike in histogram .
