1. Random variables <probability> - https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables
  ways to map outcomes of random processes to numbers e.g. flipping a coin , rolling a dice .  It is different from a normal variable in the sense that it can take on many values and generally it is used for cleaner notation and we generally take its probabilities . 
  
2. Central Limit theorem <statistics - If we sample a random variable repeatedly with large enough sample size , sample mean will have normal distribution irrespective of original data distribution of random variable . This is useful for hypothesis testing .
